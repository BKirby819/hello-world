My name is Brian Kirby and I live in Lexington, KY.  I have primarily lived here since 1992 when I moved here to study at the University of Kentucky.  I was initially a computer science major, but eventually switched my major to Political Science and completed my BA in 1997.  I also earned a BA in Economics from UK in 2006 as well.
